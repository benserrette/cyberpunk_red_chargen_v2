        description: `Self-adaptive-AI powered smartphone; that "learns" how best to fit your needs simply by interacting with you. While not a true AI, it is more than capable of replacing any need for a secretary. When you sit back and allow your Agent to manage your life, everything is easier, including making sure you have time to do what you need to do (crimes, killing people, getting away with it, and so forth) instead of going to the store to get something you forgot. There are many reasons why almost everyone has one. Things your Agent can do:
        • Make phone calls in voice or video and record them, forward them, or send them to voicemail, which pretty much only Agents actually end up listening to nowadays.
        • Surf the Data Pool.
        • .Scan the Data Pool to locate a known location and bring up directions.
        • Keep your schedule for you and act independently on events, like ordering a gift and having it delivered to the recipient.
        • Maintain a personality complete with name, voice, and virtual body. Some particularly lonely individuals reprogram their Agents to act as surrogate lovers or friends.
        • Suggest clothes for you to buy.
        • Record audio and video to the Agent's standard Memory Chip.
        • Link to your Cyberware to share data storage with them and the Agent's Memory Chip.
        • Link to most appliances in your living space.
        • Monitor your use of easily acquired resources (Cheap, Everyday, or Costly) and automatically reorder them when you get low at market price.
        • Recommend a future course of action based on your personal goals. AI may suggest unwise actions.
        In addition to all this, an Agent gives the user +2 to their Library Search Skill and +2 to their Wardrobe & Style Skill, but only if you wear the clothes your Agent suggests for you, which change every season. Multiple Agents don't multiply these bonuses. `
